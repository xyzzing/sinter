"""Named systems under test.

A benchmark run needs to say *what* it measured. Systems are declared in
``benchmarks/systems.json`` rather than assembled on the command line, so a
run's report can name exactly what it ran and a reader can reproduce it.

Declaring systems in a file also keeps the A/B honest: two arms differ by a
declared field, not by whatever flags happened to be typed.
